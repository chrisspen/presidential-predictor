    The corpus used to make a prediction for the 2016 election.

/home/chris/git/presidential-predictor/src/fixtures/presidential_candidates_2016_extended.ods

    Original corpus extended to include elections going back to 1944. Does not improve prediction, due to lots of missing variables in older elections.

/home/chris/git/presidential-predictor/src/fixtures/presidential_candidates_current.ods

    Primary training corpus used for future elections, only going back 30 years.

/home/chris/git/presidential-predictor/src/fixtures/presidential_elections.csv

Format
------

You'll see several columns like "Won NH", "Vote NH", and "Win Margin NH".

These mean:

    "Won X" = the candidate won this state during the primaries

    "Vote X" = the percent of the vote in this state that they won by during the primaries

    "Win Margin X" = the difference between the percent they won by minus their opponent's percent of the vote
